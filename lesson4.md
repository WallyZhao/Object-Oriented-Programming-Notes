 # Summary of OOP 
 
 ### Class: Description of a new object that can be made 
  * Attributes: Variables/Data that belongs to the class
  * Methods: Functions that you call upon to use 

### Encapsulation: Information hiding, restricting the access to the classes/objects' attributes 

### Inheritance: WHen an object or a class is based on another class that is already created
  * Single - A parent class
  * Multiple - Multiple parent classes 
  * Multilevel - 

### Polymorphism: A method that can be used across different classes that is depend on the parameters 

*Poly* --> Many 

*Morphism* --> Forms 

You can have:

  * Two differnet classes have the same attributes and methods 
  * A child of a parent can have an **overrided** method where the child would use the method differently.
