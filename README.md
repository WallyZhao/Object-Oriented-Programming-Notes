### Important note 
============================================================================================================
- **(self) is written after every method because it acts as a way to refer back to the method in each class (using.self)**
============================================================================================================
- If you don't make the ncode printable, then you will not be able to print it using print()
- Most difficult part of OOP is creating your own methods
- Whenever you create a "__str__" you should always create a "__repr__" as well.
